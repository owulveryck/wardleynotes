In the old days, this is how I use to organise ... by silos based around aptitude e.g. skillsets such as engineering and finance. There was always fight between silos and even within silos ... <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dxed-ClXcAA9OTV.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/576ed779e5458fd20367e21e7342acb7..png" src="../images/1px.png"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
... then after a bit of time, I introduced the idea of small teams with product owners. The small teams had a mix of aptitudes (i.e. skills). The result was - more fights ... <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxeePvrWwAA2kzE.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/image0005.png" src="../images/image0006.png"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
... then around 2004, I had an amazing idea. The conflict was caused by two types of work - the new development and core operations. The solution was simple, split the company into two different focus. I started with IT. The result was all out warfare and endless fights ... <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dxee3vYWwAAGXD3.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/image0007.png" src="../images/image0008.png"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
By 2005 I had maps and could understand what had happened. Basically, Dev would build on Core services, evolve the technology and then ask Core to look after it. Core would respond &#34;Where&#39;s the documentation&#34; and a new fight broke out ... <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxefW5nXgAAvAR7.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/image0009.png" src="../images/image0010.png"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
... nothing was ever making the cross over (i.e. nothing evolved across the blue box). Dev had pressure to deliver more, so it would start to build on components it had made ... <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxefpIbX0AAqk1M.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/image0011.png" src="../images/image0012.png"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
... the net result was increasing instability (a house of cards), nothing evolving and open warfare. I realised, through equal mixes of luck, discussion and articles that I had read, that in our organisation we had a &#34;missing middle&#34; ... <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dxef-TAWwAAtEoz.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/image0013.png" src="../images/image0014.png"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
So, we set about to fix it. Over time we split the organisation into three parts built around attitude i.e. engineering isn&#39;t just engineering, there are very different approaches needed if you&#39;re build the novel or productising or industrialising ... <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxegoGQWkAAap-M.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/image0015.png" src="../images/image0016.png"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
... this was the genesis of the whole pioneer, settler and town planner. A realisation that different cultures and methods were needed , it didn&#39;t matter if it was engineering or finance or marketing ... <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxehrX-W0AA3zoK.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/image0017.png" src="../images/image0018.png"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
... work was still done in small teams with product owners but those teams had the same attitude (e.g. settler) but a mix of aptitudes (e.g. finance, marketing, development) ... <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dxeh4V1X4AALniE.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/image0019.png" src="../images/image0020.png"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
... however, we still need to cope with change. Hence we had a mechanism of theft i.e. what the pioneers did was stolen by settlers and turned into products. Later the town planners would steal components of this and industrialise it to services which pioneers would use. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxeiMNFWkAEQwh3.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/image0021.png" src="../images/image0022.png"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
However, to make it work we needed to understand our landscape. The structure simply helped us manage evolutionary flow - we still had to break down components into two, determine where we were going to attack etc. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxejOmIXQAAWMkU.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/image0023.png" src="../images/image0024.png"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
However, it also helped me to understand what went wrong with my earlier efforts. From my experience, the Settlers tend to get on with most people but the Pioneers and Town Planners (both of which you need) tend to fight a lot if you stick them in a room together ...
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
In my early efforts, I organised by aptitude (i.e. skills). But those attitudes (pioneer etc) still existed. I was just unaware. I was building depts and teams with pioneers and town planners in. Fights were bound to happen. If you&#39;re using small teams, think about attitude. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxeohXyXgAAIcDw.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="../images/image0025.png" src="../images/image0026.png"/></a></span>

When I split into two focus - Dev &amp; Core, I reinforced Pioneers &amp; Town Planners. I diminished the Settlers (i.e. they had little power). This just created even more fights. </p></div>

It&#39;s not only silos by function, cells or bimodal that can cause problems. You need to manage evolutionary flow. That&#39;s a problem I see with the Spotify model. No mechanism for this, it&#39;ll stagnate. </p></div>
<p>
Now, these days I don&#39;t research into organisational design because the only effective way of doing this is to run a company and experiment directly on it. I don&#39;t trust consultants intuition unless they run their own company this way. My last experiments on this was 2007 ...
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
... unfortunately, most of the work I read on organisational design is fairly dreadful. I&#39;m not interested in leadership myself but if you do find yourself in that position, do understand that most are still exploring how to organise themselves. No-one has the perfect answer.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
... oh, if some consultant turns up with a solution to organisation then ask them to show you how they run their company in this way. You don&#39;t want case studies of others, you want to see them running it for themselves. If they can&#39;t, ask them to close the door on the way out.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
I can only tell you where I got to by the end of 2007 and the idea of pioneer, settler and town planner was derived from Robert X. Cringely (pseudonym) Accidental Empires concept of &#34;Infantry, Commando and Police&#34; for describing companies. Just done in one company ...

If you want to go down this path of pioneer, settler and town planner then someone you must grab (who was there at the beginning of this all including <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/WardleyMaps">#WardleyMaps</a>) is <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesaduncan">@jamesaduncan</a> - there are only a handful of people I&#39;ve met in my own journey that are as good as James.
